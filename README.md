# BlockChain
some code to learn and understand better how blockchain work
for exp throuth SolidityContractGameCryptoZombie.ipynb , i try to create a Dapp (Distributed app) as a simple game on Etherium network by Solidity language.
Based on my latest studies , each Dapp consist of several Smart contracts that inharit from their parents and their major advantages are long term life on blockchain and ability to exchange crypto currencies with much more privacy and less limitation beyond the borders.
in this project we have a game character called cryptoZambie who can feed from little poor creaure called kitty even his/her kind after a random fight like a gambling. 
people can have own zombies with chosen name, appearance and fight or pay a little fee for level up (ofcourse its cheating).
